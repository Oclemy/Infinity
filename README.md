# Infinity
A reliable but simple to use recyclerview infinite pagination library. Add infinite pagination with as few as three lines of code

## Motivation

In almost all my projects involving making API requests or accessing firebase data, I always need pagination. I tend to apply load more or endless pagination. There are alot of libraries out there but they just have too much fat. I needed a simple and reliable library to inform me of when I have reached the bottom of my recyclerview so that I can fetch the next page. It needed to do this without forcing me to specify the number of data I need or what page I am in, just tell me if I reach the bottom so that I can maintain the page index myself. Well that's what this library is for.
